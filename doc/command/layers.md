# Description

The *layers* command displays a list of all the named layers currently provided by the *nswtopo* software. Use the `--state` option to show layers for a particular state only.

Many layers are part of a higher collection. For example, adding *nsw/topographic* will include all the layers listed in the *nsw/topographic/\** hierarchy.
