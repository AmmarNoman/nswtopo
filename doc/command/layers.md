# Description

The *layers* command displays a list of all the named layers currently provided by the *nswtopo* software. Use the `--state` option to show layers for a particular state only.

Remember that many layers are part of a higher collection. For example, adding *nsw/topographic* will include all *nsw/topographic/\** layers below it.
