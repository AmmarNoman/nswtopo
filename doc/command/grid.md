# Description

The *grid* command adds a UTM grid to the map. Grid coordinates for northings and eastings are labelled along the map edges.

Used in a digital map, grid lines serve mostly to indicate scale, with one grid square traditionally representing a square kilometre on the ground. The grid interval can be changed with the `--interval` option.
